# Stock-price-prediction
# Introduction:
Forcasting the stock market movements are usually based on only one data source and thus may not cover factors that can affect the stocks.Here I have exploit the consistencies among differnt data sources and developed a multi-source instance model that can combine sentiments as well as quantative data into comprehensive framework.This approach is able to determine theimportance of each data source identify the crucial input information that is considered to drive the movements, making the prediction interpretable.

# Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to predict closing prices of stocks using historical data from yahoo finance, using Deep Learning model, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
